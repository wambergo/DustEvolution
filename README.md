# DustEvolution

This repository contains a simulation of the dust grains evolution and growth in the protoplanetary disc. 
The dynamics and processes in the simluation include radial drift, vertical settling, turbulent mixing and coagulation in the
disc which all are infuences that the grains are exposed to on their path to becoming planets.
