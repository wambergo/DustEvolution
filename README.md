# DustEvolution

This repository contains a simulation of the dust grains evolution and growth in the protoplanetary disc. 
The dynamics and processes in the simluation include radial drift, vertical settling, turbulent mixing and coagulation in the
disc which all are infuences that the grains are exposed to on their path to becoming planets.

## Dust dynamics 

### Temperature evolution
The evolution of the temperature in the midplane of the protoplanetary disc as a function of the distance r from the central star.

### Evolution of dust surface density
Top: Shows the evolution for particles with radius a = 10-2 cm
Bottom: Shows the evolution for particles with radius a = 10-4 cm
